# first-sql-project
This is my first project using SQL working with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. The sample table is from Code Academy, and contains one table. 

I am using the dataset to answer the following questions: 

   **1. What years are covered by the dataset?**

   **2. What is the largest population size for _Gabon_ in this dataset?**

   **3. What wee the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?**

   **4. What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 milion in the year 2010?**

   **5. How many countries in this dataset have the word "Islands" in their name?"**

   **6. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?**
